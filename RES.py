This script runs representative elementary size (RES) analysis on a binary 2D image.

it takes path to the 2D tif file and a list of image sizes, and number of random samples as inputs to caluclate:
two-point correlation function (S2) and its scaled version  (F2) in 2D.
These values can then be analyzed for RES calculation for that image.
